1. Project Overview
  - State the problem to be solved and briefly discuss the algorithms, system structure, and other related issues to resolve the problem 

-A blind date recommended by a chatbot (pseudonym: Hong Ik-i)
-Through a conversation with Hong ik-i, you can recommend the other person and ask about the other person.
-Provides a cartoonized user's picture for fun without pursuing only appearance

2. Background and Motivations
  - the reason you chose the problem (is it worthy?)
  - present related studies(papers, produce, prototypes, ...) and compare them with your idea/approach

-Unlike existing blind date apps that judge the person by appearance, the reliance on appearance is reduced through cartoonization.
-Alleviate the awkward atmosphere of blind date through conversation with chatbot.

3. Component Technologies
  - describe component technologies in detail for implementing your approach/idea to solve the problem
  - existing algorithm, system to be used
  - your original algorithm, product to be used

-Using natural language processing technology, it identifies the user's requirements and gives an appropriate answer.
-Change the user's picture using cartoon filtering technology.

4. Detailed Design and Implementation
  - describe the 4 parts below in detail

  4.1 Requirement Analysis
  - define/describe system requirements and analysis

-Make the chatbot use a friendly tone.
-Through a preliminary investigation, it recommends someone who is likely to fit you well.
-By adjusting the degree of cartoon filtering, the original image can be inferred.

  4.2 System Design (Synthesis and Analysis)
    - overall structure, data and control flow, data structures and algorithms, user interface,
      interface to DBMS, …

-Tests are conducted to obtain some information when registering as a member.
-Ask Hong ik-i for an introduction and get a recommendation for the other person.
-You can ask Hong ik-i for information about the other person before and during the conversation with the other person.

  4.3 Development Environment
  - OS, programming languages, software, tools, IDE, …

-Create a chatbot that processes natural language using Google's Dialogflow and Python.
-Use CartoonGAN to cartoonize the user's picture.
-Create an app using React Native and Node.js.

  4.4 Test and Demonstration Plan 
  - describe your plan on module and system integration tests
  - present demonstration scenarios in detail

-Each time a function is implemented, it tests itself.
-Gather a few users and have them try it out and review the requirements and others.
